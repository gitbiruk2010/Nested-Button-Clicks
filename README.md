Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

    Node.js (LTS version recommended)
    npm (usually comes with Node.js)

Installation

    Clone the Repository (Optional)

    If your project is hosted in a Git repository, start by cloning the project to your local machine using the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

    Powershell

    git clone 

Navigate to the Project Directory

Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory:

powershell

cd path/to/your/project

Install Dependencies

Install the project dependencies by running:

    npm install

    This command reads the package.json file and installs all the necessary packages for your project.

Setup

No additional setup is needed if you're working with a Create React App-based project. The installation step takes care of setting up your environment.
Starting the App

To start the application, run the following command in your project directory:

npm start

This command starts the development server and opens the application in your default web browser.
Viewing the App

After starting the app, it should automatically open in your web browser. If it doesn't, you can manually open your web browser and visit:

http://localhost:3000

You should now see your React application running. Enjoy developing!
